*The Picture of Dorian Gray* is a novel written by Oscar Wilde in 1890 England. It is written in the late [[Main/Engelska/Viktorianska eran\|Victorian era]], and counts as Gothic fiction as well as decadent literature.

## Themes

### Manipulation and morals

Lord Henry is a manipulator; he convinces Dorian to do thing that might not be great, he basically shapes Dorian’s personality. Basil is also manipulating Dorian, but he’s trying to make Dorian have proper morals and be good.

Lord Henry and Basil are like the Devil and angel on Dorian’s shoulders. In the end, the Devil wins and the angel dies.

### Faustian bargain

Dorian sells his soul for eternal youth, I suppose.

### Hedonism

Dorian Gray is a hedonist. He wishes to create a new kind of hedonism, even.

### Narcissism

Dorian is narcissus. He is selfish. He blames everything on everyone else and never takes any blame.

## Important characters and story

### Basil Hallward

Basil Hallward is a painter, and the first character we meet in the novel. He met Dorian Gray at a dinner, and was immediately sucked in by Dorian’s beauty. Dorian then became Basil’s sitter.

Basil was a very moral man and was what most people would consider a purely good man would be. He was not pushy, he was humble, he tried to guide Dorian to be like him. He was sad when Dorian gets closer to Lord Henry but accepted it. Basil painted the picture of Dorian Gray, his greatest work yet, but was ready to destroy it when Dorian said that he hated it.

### Lord Henry “Harry” Wotton

Lord Henry was Basil’s friend. He was intelligent and manipulative, probably a sociopath, definitely a cynic. He wanted to learn about the human psyche and how sins would affect a person. The devil on the should of Dorian Gray.

### Dorian Gray

#### The beginning (ch. 1-3)

Dorian Gray is the main character of the story, as seen in the title. He was 17 years old in the beginning of the book: “I shall be of age in less than a year” (p. 71). He was an orphan, his father was killed in a duel and his mother died shortly after his birth. He was then taken care of by his grandfather, the one who sent the man that killed Dorian’s father.

He was the most beautiful creature one has ever encountered, although no real description of his looks were ever made. His mother was supposedly also very beautiful.

In the beginning of the book, he was a very blank slate when it comes to personality and morals. He was innocent and never sinned, had absolutely no personality and was easily convinced to do things. Lord Henry used this to his advantage and very easily manipulated Dorian to do various things, and introduced sins and dubious morals to his otherwise clean mind.

#### Sibyl Vane and her demise (ch. 4-10)

Sibyl Vane was Dorian Gray’s lover. She was, like Dorian, 17 years old. Sibyl was an actress in the East End, and so was her mother. She also had a brother, James “Jim” Vane, who was a sailor and went going to Australia. He warned her about Dorian, told her to be careful with people who seem like gentlemen. He also threatened to seek down and kill Dorian if he ever wrongs her, *foreshadowing*. We find out that Sibyl’s father was also a gentleman, but then left her mother heartbroken.

Sibyl and her mother were very poor and under contract to the Jew who owned the theatre, so when Sibyl met Dorian, who looked like a rich man from the upper class, she thought that he could save her from the Jew. Dorian loved her because she could act so well and not only because she was beautiful, but the reason she acted so well in the first place was because she truly believed in who she was playing. When she experienced true love, her acting became unbearable. This happened the time Basil and Lord Henry also followed Dorian to the theatre, and they were thoroughly disappointed after having heard Dorian speak so highly of her. Dorian confronted her after the show and asked why she couldn’t act, but even though she explained herself, Dorian was not satisfied and left her, saying that he shall never contact her again.

After being left by Dorian, she was of course heartbroken, and proceeded to commit suicide the same night. No trace to Dorian was left, since she never mentioned to anyone else what his name was, only *Prince Charming*. She died like Juliet, but without a Romeo beside her.

At the same time, Dorian looked at his picture, and realized something had changed on it. A slight blemish at the lip, a bit of corruption. He realized that his wish might’ve come true, he himself would not age but the picture would experience every sin and the passage of time. He saw how brutal he had been to Sibyl and how he had been manipulated by Lord Henry. He decided that he shall marry Sibyl anyway, and that he shall not contact Lord Henry. The next morning, he wrote a letter addressed to Sibyl seeking forgiveness, not knowing that she was dead. When Lord Henry comes, he informs Dorian of the news, and invites him to dinner and to the opera, which Dorian accepts. Very quickly, Dorian has gone from not speaking with Lord Henry again, to embracing his eternal youth and deciding that he shall lead the most hedonist life possible.

Basil also comes around and wishes to see the picture, and wanting it to be displayed at a gallery for a month. Dorian refuses without telling Basil why, but Basil with his morals seeks no answer after rejection and accepts it. After this close encounter, Dorian moves the picture to an abandoned room.

Dorian grows closer to Lord Henry, and further away from Basil.

#### 8+ years later, unnecessary chapter (ch. 11)

Dorian has gotten a bit of a reputation. He is now at least 25 years old. He is paranoid most of the time about someone finding the painting, so he does not leave England for an extended period of time anymore, he has given up houses in different countries. He has studied gems and embroideries and perfumes and whateverthefuck.

#### He’s 38 years old and a murderer (ch. 12-16)

On his 38th birthday he met Basil, who was on his way to Paris for art. He showed Basil the picture. He killed Basil. His alibi was flawless. The day after he called for an old friend to help him, only they weren’t friends anymore, the other person, chemist Alan Campbell, wanted nothing to do with Dorian. A little blackmail did the work though and Alan had no choice but to help Dorian dispose of the body with some nitric acid.

He later had dinner with some people including Lord Henry and got a bit nervous, but nothing of importance happened.

After Dorian got rid of Basil’s clothes he then went out of town to get some opium. There a woman called him Prince Charming, and as it happens, a particular sailor by the name of James Vane was also there. He followed Dorian out and was going to kill him, until Dorian explained that he couldn’t possibly be the man he was looking for, since he still had the face of a pure twenty-year-old and Sibyl had died eighteen years prior. After Dorian escapes, the woman comes out and swears the Dorian was surely the most horrible person there, and that his face had not changed for eighteen years. James begun pursuing Dorian.

#### A wild Jim appears (ch. 17-18)

During some sort of party a week later, Dorian suddenly fainted, for he had seen the face of James Vane outside of a window. A few days later Dorian’s friend accidentally shot and killed James while hunting. Now Dorian is safe.

#### Dorian’s going to be good (ch. 19)

Dorian told Harry that he is going to be good. He left a girl in order to not corrupt her, which Harry of course tried to paint as a sin. Dorian said that it’s no use, for Harry shall not influence him anymore.

It is also learnt that Alan Campbell committed suicide, without telling anyone of his deeds. Lord Henry was also getting divorced because his wife left him.

#### The end (ch. 20)

Dorian checked in on the painting because now that he was good, the painting should have gotten less corrupt. But much to his dismay, it had only gotten worse with more blood and with a hint of hypocrisy. Dorian becomes furious and asks himself why he hadn’t destroyed the painting a long time ago, considering it was the only thing affecting him negatively. The painting was his conscience.

He took the knife he killed Basil with and destroyed the painting. A loud cry was heard, police and servants found him along with a beautiful painting of a young man. He lied there, corrupted like that painting was, an old man with sin and blood on him no one could recognise being Dorian Gray, with a knife in his heart. Dorian Gray had died, suicide, apparently.
